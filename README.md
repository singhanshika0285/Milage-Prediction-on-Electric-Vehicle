# Milage-Prediction-on-Electric-Vehicle
This project helps in predicting the range of an electric vehicle machine learning.
Developed a predictive model to forecast the range (mileage) of electric vehicles based on characteristics such as battery capacity, charging rate, and vehicle type. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and trained models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Assessed performance using measurements like RÂ² score and mean squared error.
